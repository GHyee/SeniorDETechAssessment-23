# Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
Using the dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation, create a machine learning model to predict the buying price given the following parameters:

Maintenance = High <br>
Number of doors = 4 <br>
Lug Boot Size = Big <br>
Safety = High <br>
Class Value = Good <br>

## Data Modelling

The data modelling is done in the notebook, go to [predict_price.ipynb](/5_machine_learning/predict_price.ipynb).
